# Visualising-Process-Synchronisation
The dining philosophers problem is considered a classic synchronization problem. This problem
deals with resource allocation, it is an example of a large class of concurrency-control problems.

The main objective of this project was to learn the use of semaphores and threads and to
understand the concept of deadlock, race conditions, resource allocation, and process
synchronization.
